# Minimum Working Example

This can be used to easily test if things are working with LOVE2D. This directory is a simple game which just prints "Hello World".

To test, copy the `luasteam.dll` or `luasteam.so`, and the Steam SDK dll or so here as well, then run the game with `/path/to/your/love.exec .`. If you see "Hello World", you're good to go.
